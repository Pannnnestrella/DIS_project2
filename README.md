# Book Recommendation System

This repository implements a book recommendation system based on collaborative filtering, machine learning, and feature engineering approaches. It includes data preprocessing, analysis, modeling, and result visualization.

Important Notice:
Due to time constraints during the final integration phase, some file paths and folder names in the scripts and notebooks may still use temporary or placeholder names.
Before running the scripts, ensure that you update the paths to match the actual structure of your local environment.

## **Data Sources**
The following datasets are used in this project,

Provided by DIS course:
train.csv: User-book ratings for training.
test.csv: User-book pairs for rating prediction.
books.csv: Book metadata (e.g., titles, authors).

Generated by us:
user_features.csv: User-level features (e.g., demographics, preferences).
Augmented Data: books_augmented.csv and books_features.csv.

## **Models Directory**
The models/ directory contains various scripts and notebooks for implementing and optimizing recommendation models. The structure includes:

**.py files**: These Python scripts focus on parameter optimization, such as grid search for tuning hyperparameters like alpha, thresholds, and top-k selection.
**.ipynb files**: These Jupyter notebooks are primarily for demonstration and straightforward execution of models without parameter tuning. You can run them directly on platforms like Kaggle for quicker experiments.

### **Hybrid Methods**
The hybrid methods/ folder combines basic collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and other strategies. Here’s a breakdown:

1. Alpha Adjustments:
Fine-tuning alpha for balancing item-based and user-based recommendation models.
Implementing Adaptive Alpha, which can dynamically adjusts the weight between user-based and item-based predictions based on the number of ratings.

2. Top-k Selection:
Determining whether to use the top-k most similar users/items when calculating final ratings.
Grid search is used to optimize the value of k for better performance.

3. Threshold Selection:
Identifying the most suitable threshold for ratings.
For items with ratings below the threshold, the recommender calculates and returns the mean value of those low ratings.

4. Parameter Combination:
Performing grid search to identify the optimal mix of parameters, including alpha, top-k, and threshold, for hybrid models.
